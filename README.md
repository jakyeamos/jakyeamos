# Hey, I'm Jakye 👋

Software Engineer building fullstack systems with end-to-end type safety and cloud-native infrastructure.

Currently finishing up my CS degree at Case Western Reserve University.

Previously: 3x Amazon SDE Intern (Ads + Fintech teams), Technical Consultant at Deepr (a16z).

## What I'm building

🎧 Soundscape (in progress) — A full-stack music rating platform built around typed APIs, real-time aggregation, and scalable analytics.
Implements album and track rating pipelines, rating distribution visualizations, user preference modeling, and feature-flagged rollouts using a type-safe monorepo architecture.
Next.js · TypeScript · tRPC · Prisma · PostgreSQL · Redis · Tailwind · Docker

🛠️ Pre-CR Suite (v1 shipped, actively maintained) — A cross-editor code review preparation suite that validates test coverage on changed lines, runs smart pre-review checks, and generates documentation before a PR is opened. Works across VS Code, Neovim, and any LSP-compatible editor via a custom language server. Includes coverage overlays, flaky test detection, review time estimation, and automated PR checklists.
TypeScript · Language Server Protocol · VS Code API · Git diff parsing · pnpm monorepo

🔍 RAG Knowledge Search (up next) — Vector search for internal docs with semantic matching and citation tracking.
Python · FastAPI · Pinecone · OpenAI

💳 Market Payment Platform (in progress) — Stripe integration for my existing marketplace business. Multi-vendor splits, escrow, the whole deal.
Next.js · TypeScript · Stripe API · PostgreSQL

🤖 AI Interview Coach (planned) — Practice technical interviews with real-time feedback on your answers.
